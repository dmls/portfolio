# Portfolio site built with AngularJS

This is a lightweight AngularJS app to showcase info about myself and projects that I've worked on.

It was built with a typical AngularJS seed from [AngularJS](http://angularjs.org/) and trimmed 
down to keep it straightforward and simple.

The app is a single page and contains a handful of content templates along with custom styles
and javascript functionality.

## Getting Started

To get you started you can simply clone the repository and install the dependencies with `npm install`.

### Prerequisites

You must have node.js and its package manager (npm) installed.  
You can get them from [http://nodejs.org/](http://nodejs.org/).

### Clone the project 

Clone the angular-seed repository using [git][git]:

```
git clone https://github.com/dmls/portfolio.git
cd portfolio
```
### Run the Application

The simplest way to start this server is:

```
npm start
```

Now browse to the app at `http://localhost:8000`.
