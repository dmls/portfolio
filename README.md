# Portfolio site built with AngularJS

This is a lightweight AngularJS app to showcase info about myself and projects that I've worked on.

It was built with a typical AngularJS seed from [AngularJS](http://angularjs.org/) and trimmed 
down to keep it straightforward and simple.

The app is a single page and contains a handful of content templates along with custom styles
and javascript functionality.

They can be obtained from [http://nodejs.org/](http://nodejs.org/).
